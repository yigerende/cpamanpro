# OAuth Login

OAuth Login adds or reauthorizes accounts. It answers "how do I get a usable auth file saved?" Account enablement, batch maintenance, and status decisions belong in [Auth Files](./auth-files.md).

## Available Entries

The page shows login methods based on CPA and plugin capabilities. Common entries include:

- Codex OAuth
- Anthropic / Claude OAuth
- Antigravity OAuth
- Kimi OAuth
- xAI OAuth
- iFlow OAuth
- Plugin-provided OAuth
- Vertex credential import

Some entries appear only when the runtime supports them. If an entry is missing, check CPA version, plugin status, and configuration.

## Standard Flow

1. Click the provider login button.
2. Complete login and authorization in the provider page.
3. Wait for the panel to poll auth state.
4. After success, open Auth Files and confirm the file was saved.
5. Send one low-cost request and confirm it in [Monitoring](./monitoring.md).

OAuth success does not guarantee request success. After saving, still check provider configuration, auth-file binding, model rules, and quota state.

## Remote Browser Callback

If CPAMP runs on a remote server, the provider may redirect to `http://localhost:...`. In that case:

1. Copy the full callback URL from the browser address bar.
2. Paste it into the callback URL field.
3. Submit it and wait for auth state to update.
4. If the page reports an upgrade or API issue, check CPA version and management API availability.

Paste the full callback URL. Do not manually extract `code` or `state`; that can break state matching.

## Vertex Credential Import

Vertex usually requires a service-account file and a location. After import, check the returned project, email, location, and file name.

If import succeeds but requests fail, check both [AI Providers](./ai-providers.md) for Vertex routing and Auth Files for project ID.

## Reauthorize

Reauthorize when:

- Auth Files says the account needs login again.
- Monitoring shows `token_revoked`, `invalidated oauth token`, or a similar summary.
- Codex Inspection recommends reauth.
- The upstream account password, organization, or authorization scope changed.

After reauth, do not immediately delete old files. Confirm the new file works first, then clean up accounts that are clearly invalid.

## Security Notes

Authorization links, callback URLs, and auth files can contain sensitive data. Do not paste full values into public issues or chats. For troubleshooting, describe the stage and share sanitized errors.
